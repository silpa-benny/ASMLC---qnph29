This study uses a dataset containing medical records of patients, including various health factors like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and previous medical history. By looking at these factors, we want to develop a model that can accurately predict if a patient is at high risk of a fatal heart attack. This is important because doctors can use this information to better manage patients' health and make more informed decisions about their treatment.
